# Array Shift and Insert in Rust

This Rust program demonstrates how to shift elements in a fixed-size array to the left and insert a new number (entered by the user) at the end of the array.

## ğŸ§  What It Does

- Starts with an array of 5 integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Prompts the user to enter a new number
- Shifts all array elements to the left by one
- Appends the new number to the end
- Prints the updated array
